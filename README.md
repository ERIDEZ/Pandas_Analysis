# Videogames analysis

## By Erick Hernandez

In this project I was able to demonstrate my DataFrame handling and analysis. This project was about performing a top-down analysis of a database of fictional videogames, in which I was required to identify trends regarding customer purchasing preferences, their demographics and videogame composition.

This challenge involves the usage of Pandas library, from which I mainly used:
    · Merging, dropping and filling
    · CSV import
    · Groupby objects
